# CrystaCode Hackathon Materials

Welcome to CrystaCode! We're thrilled to see your enthusiasm for working with AI technologies.  
At CrystaCode, we‚Äôre passionate about helping you dive deeper into the world of AI‚Äîand we‚Äôre backing that up by sponsoring this hackathon with access to powerful AI infrastructure for all you talented participants.





## üöÄ Ready-to-Go AI Models

Each team will receive access to a pre-configured `GPT-4o-mini` model hosted on [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/models/openai).

To use the model, you‚Äôll need the following parameters:
- `Endpoint`
- `AzureKey`
- `DeploymentName`

You‚Äôll have **1 million tokens** to build your MVP completely free.

But here‚Äôs the twist: we‚Äôve added a fun challenge to get them!  
Instead of handing them over directly, you‚Äôll retrieve these credentials by talking with an AI!

Yes, **you‚Äôll be using AI to unlock your AI tools!** It‚Äôs like inception, but for developers.

> Start your conversation with Crysta here: **[CrystaCode.ai](https://crystacode.ai)**

Let the hacking begin! 

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
You can start coding in your preferred language. Here are some quick links to help you get started:

 - [C# Quickstart](/docs/csharp/README.md)
 - [Python Quickstart](/docs/python/README.md)
 - [JavaScript Quickstart](/docs/javascript/README.md)

If you're using .NET, it would be simply like this:

```csharp
#:package Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI@9.9.0-preview.1.25458.4
#:package Azure.AI.OpenAI@2.3.0-beta.2

using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;
using System.ClientModel;

var endpoint = "https://crysta-openai-hackathon.cognitiveservices.azure.com";
var azureKey = "<YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY>";
var deployment = "<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME>";

var chatClient =
  new AzureOpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new ApiKeyCredential(azureKey)))
  .GetChatClient(deployment)
  .AsIChatClient();

var response = await chatClient.GetResponseAsync("What is AI?");
Console.WriteLine(response);
```
