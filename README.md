# CrystaCode Hackathon Materials

Welcome to CrystaCode! We're thrilled to see your enthusiasm for working with AI technologies.  
At CrystaCode, weâ€™re passionate about helping you dive deeper into the world of AIâ€”and weâ€™re backing that up by sponsoring this hackathon with access to powerful AI infrastructure for all you talented participants.





## ðŸš€ Ready-to-Go AI Models

Each team will receive access to a pre-configured `GPT-4o-mini` model hosted on [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/models/openai).

To use the model, youâ€™ll need the following parameters:
- `Endpoint`
- `AzureKey`
- `DeploymentName`

Youâ€™ll have **1 million tokens** to build your MVPâ€”completely free.

But hereâ€™s the twist: weâ€™ve added a fun challenge to get them!  
Instead of handing them over directly, youâ€™ll retrieve these credentials by talking with an AI!

Yes, **youâ€™ll be using AI to unlock your AI tools!** Itâ€™s like inception, but for developers.
